            <h2>Sharingan</h2>
            <p>The Sharingan is a powerful dōjutsu, or eye technique, unique to the Uchiha clan in the Naruto universe. Known for its distinctive red iris marked by one to three tomoe (comma-shaped symbols), the Sharingan grants its user heightened perception, allowing them to anticipate and counter opponents’ movements with remarkable accuracy. Additionally, it enables users to copy observed techniques, including ninjutsu, taijutsu, and genjutsu, making it a highly versatile tool in battle. The Sharingan’s ability to cast genjutsu lets the user create powerful illusions, disorienting or controlling their opponents by manipulating their senses. While it offers incredible advantages, the Sharingan requires significant chakra to maintain, and extensive use can quickly tire the user. As a skill, the Sharingan represents the adaptability and potential of its wielder, serving as both a strategic advantage and a symbol of the Uchiha’s inherent strength and pride.</p>
